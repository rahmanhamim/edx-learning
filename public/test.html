      This module begins a journey into Python data structures by explaining the
      use of lists and tuples and how they are able to store collections of data
      in a single variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, learn about dictionaries and how they function by storing data in
      pairs of keys and values, and end with Python sets to learn how this type
      of collection can appear in any order and will only contain unique
      elements.
    </p>
    <h3>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h3>
    <p>In this lesson you will:</p>
    <ul>

        combinations and list data structures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Demonstrate understanding of dictionaries by writing structures with
        correct keys and values.
      </li>
      <li>
        Understand the differences between sets, tuples, and lists by creating
