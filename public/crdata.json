Python is    one of the world's most popular programming languages, and there has never    been greater demand for professionals with the ability to apply Python    fundamentals to drive business solutions across industries.  </p>  <p>This course will take you from zero to programming in Python in a matter of    hoursâ€”no prior programming experience necessary! You will learn Python    fundamentals, including data structures and data analysis, complete hands-on    exercises throughout the course modules, and create a final project to    demonstrate your new skills.  </p>  <p>By the end of this course, you'll feel comfortable creating basic programs,    working with data, and solving real-world problems in Python. You'll gain a    strong foundation for more advanced learning in the field, and develop    skills to help advance your career.  </p>  <p><strong>Note For learners auditing the course</strong>, please note, the    cloud base environment that you used in the previous lab is available to    paid learners only. But you can download the lab notebooks and run them in    your own Jupyter lab environment. If you want to use the cloud baced lab    environment, you can upgrade your course subscription to pay. This will    allow you to obtain a course certificate!  </p>  <p>This course can be applied to multiple Specialization or Professional    Certificate programs. Completing this course will count towards your    learning in any of the following programs: </p> </div>",
